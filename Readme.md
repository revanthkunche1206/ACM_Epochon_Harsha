Deforestation Monitoring and Prevention Using CNNs

Problem Statement  
Deforestation poses a severe threat to biodiversity, climate stability, and the livelihood of forest-dependent communities. Rapid identification of areas undergoing deforestation is critical for mitigating illegal logging, conserving forests, and achieving global sustainability goals. However, traditional methods of monitoring forest changes are often slow and resource-intensive, making it challenging to address deforestation in real time.

Our Solution 
Our system leverages Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to process satellite images and detect changes in forest cover. Using state-of-the-art deep learning techniques and real-time analysis, the solution provides the following features:
1. Satellite Image Analysis: Classifies and identifies forest cover changes using advanced CNN models.
2. Automated Alerts: Notifies relevant authorities about detected deforestation activities.
3. At-Risk Region Identification: Highlights regions with high deforestation activity for targeted interventions.
4. Visual Mapping: Uses GIS tools to create intuitive maps for monitoring forest health.

This approach ensures timely action, promotes conservation, and supports environmental protection efforts worldwide.
Step-by-Step Process

Step 1: Obtaining Satellite Images
1. *Select a Data Source*:
   -we used our dataset from kaggle.
4.Filter for Quality:
   - Select images with minimal cloud cover (e.g., <20%).

We used a CNN MODEL...with HTM and CSS as our frontend and Django as our backend


our model as an accuracy of 70.56%
